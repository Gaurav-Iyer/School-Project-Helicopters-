# School-Project-Helicopters-
This is my school project that I made. It is my take on the classic Helicopters game but created in python and meeting the guidelines set in place  by my techer.
In this, you will find the files necessary to run the game along with a special font to make the game look better. There is also a design document that I have included which was a part of my project. It discusses my ideas and contains information about the game.
There may be some issues with the file due to mac dimmensions being different from windows dimmensions ( I programmed this on a mac).
Enjoy!
